## :badminton: Introduction

The objective of this competition is to forecast future shot types and the ball's landing positions using historical hitting data. In each match, we leverage available information from the past, including the preceding four shot types, areas, and data on the two players, to predict the shot types for the next n shots and anticipate where the ball will land.
